            <p class="sub-heading">About the work</p>
            <p>Shroud is an ephemeral spatial drawing that educes what Ben Anderson terms ‘the affective atmosphere’ of life after periods of crisis. It responds to the red summer with which the year 2020 began, the subsequent health and economic crisis, and the fissures they have riven in our collective mood. This year has brought the realisation that the slow unravelling of our ecology has gained irreversible momentum. At the same time, the viral outbreak has compelled us to face with sober senses the fragility of our once taken for granted ways of living. After a year of grief and fear, this artwork asks its audience to take time to pause. To listen and hold close our ardent longing for the futures we once possessed but that dissolved into smoke, and to find the fortitude to care for each other through the uncertain future. </p>            
            
            <p class="sub-heading">About the artist</p>
            <p>Hannah Quinlivan is a young artist who has found her own distinctive voice, one which unites the intimate and the personal with the public and universal. Her art is distinctive, intense and very memorable. Sasha Grishin, 2018. Hannah Quinlivan’s abstract drawing practice has a number of strands, with ephemeral site-specific spatial drawing becoming increasingly important to her work. She completed a major public art commission for the Canberra Light Rail Network in 2019, creating drawings that were integrated into each of the thirteen stops on the new line. Over the last five years, she has exhibited site specific ephemeral artworks in Berlin, Paris, New York, Cambridge, Colorado, Italy, Hong Kong, Sydney and Melbourne. Quinlivan is represented in number of collections including the National Gallery of Australia.</p>
